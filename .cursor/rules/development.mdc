## Building and Running Tests

- Use `./gradlew test` from the repo root to compile sources and execute the JUnit suite.
- The first run may download dependencies and start a Gradle daemon, so expect a short delay.
- If dependency resolution fails, check `app/build.gradle.kts` for correct versions and retry the command.
